# Experiment-Design-Factorial-Design

STAT 424 ( Analysis of Variance) Project. The Project was part of STAT 424 subject at UIUC where We (in a group of two) deisgned an  an experiment,performed EDA, modelling (With Diagnostics) and provided interpretation of the results.

## Project Introduction

In this experiment, There are two drawn adjacent circles and in a single experiment run, a
person is tasked to mark dots in these two circles alternatively for a time period of 10 seconds.
The response measured is the number of cycles (sets of dots) marked across both circles. This
response is a measure of the level of hand-eye coordination.

The goal of the experiment is to investigate the effect of the hand type, size of the circle, and
the distance between the circles on the response. The aim is also to determine if adjustments to
either of these three factors would affect the response. Some of the research questions that can
be addressed through this experiment are as follows:<br />

1) How does the type of Hand (Dominant/ Non-Dominant) affect the coordination?<br />
2) How does the distance between the two circles (small/large) affect the coordination?<br />
3) Does changing the size of the circle ( small/ large) affect the coordination?<br />


## Executive Summary

1) Size of the circle, distance between circles are significant at 5% level
2) Choice of hand does not affect the number of cycles at 5% significance level
3) Interaction of circle size and hand type is significant
4) The difference in number of cycles between larger and smaller circle is +5.12 cycles
5) The difference in number of cycles between larger and smaller distance is â€“ 2.62 cycles
